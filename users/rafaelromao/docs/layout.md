# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

## Layout
- This is a 34 keys split layout, 3x5+2, optimized for programmers.
- This layout works well with the OS configured for the US International keyboard.
- This layout was designed mostly for coding and typing in English and Portuguese (but will probably work well for other latin languages).
- This layout considers the right hand as the dominant hand.
- The base layer can be either qwerty or colemak dhm.

## Thumb Keys
- The four thumb keys control layer transitions, when held (navigation, lower, raise and mouse).
- The two outer thumb keys act as [modifiers](modifier_keys.md), when tapped.
- The two inner thumb keys act as space, when tapped.
- Holding both outer thumb keys will activate the maintenance layer.
