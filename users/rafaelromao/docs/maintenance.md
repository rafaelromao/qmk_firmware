## Maintenance
The Maintenance layer is activated by holding both outer thumb keys.

- The Maintenance layer is where the keyboard can be configured.
- In this layer, there are options to: 
  - Put the keyboard in bootloader mode (reset). 
  - Clear the eeprom. 
  - Put the host computer in sleep mode, or power it off.
  - Change the operating system used in keys that are OS aware, like the [Default Mod key](modifiers.md).
    - Source code: [os_toggle.c](../features/os_toggle.c)
  - Disable or enable the [Mouse layer](navigation.md). 
  - Toogle any layer on. 
  - Chaging the [Base layer](layout.md) to either Qwerty or Colemak. 
- A combo with the four extreme corner keys puts the keyboard in bootloader mode. This combo is a base layer alternative for the Reset key, in the Maintenance layer, in case some unintended layer lock prevents access to it.
