## Default Mod Key 

The Default Mod key is a custom key that works as either one-shot Cmd or one-shot Ctrl.

- This key will activate the default modifier for the current operating system, which can be selected in the maintenace layer.
    - When Mac OS is selected, this key activates Cmd, otherwise it activates Ctrl.
- This key allows using the same key combinations for shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl+S, Cmd/Ctrl+C and Cmd/Ctrl+V.
- It is placed as a thumb key and behaves as follows, when tapped:
    - If any modifier is active or locked in one-shot mode, all these modifiers will be deactivated.
    - If no modifier is active or locked in one-shot mode, it activates the default modifier in one-shot mode.
- The hold behavior of this thumb key is used to activate the Navigation layer.
- Its alias in the keymap diagram is _Mod_.

## Capitalize Key 

The Capitalize key is a custom key that works both as Shift and Caps Lock.

- It is placed as a thumb key and behaves as follows, when tapped:
    - If Caps Lock is active, it deactivates Caps Lock.
    - If Shift is active or locked in one-shot mode, it activates Caps Lock.
    - If Shift is not active in one-shot mode, it activates Shift for one-shot.
- The hold behavior of this thumb key is used to activate the Mouse layer.
- Its alias in the keymap diagram is _Cap_.

## Caps Lock

- Caps Lock is also available in the functions layer, but its behavior is not what we usually see. No matter how it was activated, Caps Lock will be automatically deactivated after 2 seconds of inactivity.
