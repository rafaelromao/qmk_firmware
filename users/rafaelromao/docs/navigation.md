- Navigation layer gives access to one-shot mods in the left side and VIM style navigation in the right side.
- Mouse layer is similar to the navigation layer, but replaces the arrows and page navigation by mouse and wheel navigation.
- The mouse layer can be disabled, using the maintenance layer. In this case, the navigation layer will be activated in its place instead.
