## Macros

## Shortcuts

## Tap Dance

### Decimal Separators
- The key below the right pinky key, in the lower (numpad style) layer, sends dot on single tap and comma on double tap.

### Mouse buttons
- The third and fourth mouse buttons can be triggered double tapping the first and second button keys, on the right side of the mouse layer.
- The first and second buttons are mirrored in the left side of the mouse layer, but without this tap dancing, since it prevents drag and drop from working as expected.

### IntelliJ Shortcuts
- In the Functions and Media layers, the two outer thumb keys provide tap dances to trigger some of the most common shortcuts in the IntelliJ IDE.
  - Left Side:
    - Tap = Focus the Project Window
    - Double Tap = Run Everything
    - Hold = Find Usages
  - Right Side:
    - Tap = Quick Actions
    - Double Tap = Search Everywhere
    - Hold = Next Error/Warning
