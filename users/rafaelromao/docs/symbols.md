### Symbols

- Symbols are spread across the lower and raise layers, making them easier to reach with a single hand.
- All symbols are conveniently placed for software programming and VIM commands.

### VIM
- Symbols that are commonly used in VIM are placed in the right side of the raise layer, easily accessible using only the right hand. 
- Navigation with hjkl is ignored in favor of the navigation with the fingers in the home position, in the navigation layer.
- For that to work better, hjkl and backspace should be disabled in normal and visual modes.
```vim
nnoremap h <nop>
nnoremap j <nop>
nnoremap k <nop>
nnoremap l <nop>
nnoremap <BACKSPACE> <nop>
vnoremap h <nop>
vnoremap j <nop>
vnoremap k <nop>
vnoremap l <nop>
vnoremap <BACKSPACE> <nop>
```
- This trade-off turns the navigation easier and ubiquitous and makes even more sense when using Colemak.
### Accentuation
- Using the lower layer, we can type `, ', ", ~ and ^ as independent symbols, while in the left side of the raise layer, we can find these keycodes as accents. I had to program some macros in qmk to make it work this way though.
- For example, considering qwerty, holding my left thumb + tapping s + releasing the thumb + tapping c, gives me 'c, while holding my right thumb + tapping f + tapping c, gives me รง. The same goes for the other accents.
