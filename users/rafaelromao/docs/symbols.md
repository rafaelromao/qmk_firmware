# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

### Symbols and Numbers
Symbols and Numbers are available in the two classic layers, Lower and Raise, activated holding the space and backspace thumb keys, respectively.

- Symbols are available in the left side of the Lower layer and in the right side of the Raise layers, making them easier to reach with a single hand.
- Accents are available in the left side of the Raise layer, so they require two hands.
- Number are available in the right side of the Lower layer, also requiring two hands, but that can be mitigated using a combo to toggle the layer on using only the right hand.
- The Lower and Raise layers can be toggled on tapping or holding a three keys combo with the right and left hands, respectively.
- A combo with three fingers can be used to toggle these layers off.
- Enter and Esc are available in the Lower and Raise layer, as well as in the Navigation and Mouse layers, in the same positions.

### Lower Symbols
- String delimiters, conditional operators, parenthesis and square brackets, among others, are found in the left side of the Lower layer.
- Source code: [macros.c](../features/macros.c)

### Raise Symbols
- Symbols that are commonly used in VIM are placed in the right side of the Raise layer, making them easily accessible using only the right hand.
- Curly braces and angle brackets are also found in the right side of this layer.
- Some common programmer n-grams, like ->, =>, \<!--, -->, <>, />, !=, :=, +=, -=, ${, can all be typed rolling through keys in the right hand.

### Numpad
- In the right side of the Lower layer, there is a Numpad, replicating the traditional Numpad of 100% keyboards, except for the math operators.
- The Raise layer can be activated on top of the Lower layer, holding the backspace thumb key, which makes it easier to access math operators when working with the numpad.
- The Numpad can also be activated using only the right hand, holding (or tapping, for one-shot) the backspace thumb key plus the botton row pinky key.
- A tap dance is used to give access to both comma and dot in the pinky key, which makes it easier to use different locales with different decimal separators.
- Source code: [tapdance.c](../features/tapdance.c)

### Accentuation
- Accents are available in the left side of the Raise layer, while non-accent versions of these symbols are available in the left side of the Lower layer and in the right side of the Raise layer.
- For example, activating the Lower layer (holding space) + tapping ' (left middle finger) + releasing space + tapping c, gives me 'c, while activating the Raise layer (holding backspace) + tapping ' (left index finger) + tapping c, gives me รง.
