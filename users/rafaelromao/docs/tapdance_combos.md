# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

## Tap Dance

- The key below the right pinky key, in the lower (numpad style) layer, sends dot on single tap and comma on double tap.
- The third and fourth mouse buttons can be triggered double tapping the first and second button keys, on the right side of the mouse layer.
- The first and second buttons are mirrored in the left side of the mouse layer, but without this tap dancing, since it prevents drag and drop from working as expected.

## Combos

In the base layers, considering the QWERTY layout:
- UIO sends TAB. 
- SDF sends ESC.
- JKL sends ENTER.
- XCV activates the raise layer.
- M,. activates the lower layer.

In the lower layer:
- M,. activates the functions layer.

In the mouse layer:
- M,. activates the navigation layer.

In all layers but the base and maintenance:
- JKL return to the previous layer.
