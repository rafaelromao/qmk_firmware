# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

## Mod-Taps and Layer-Taps

- Home block modifiers are available on both sides of the base layers.
  - Qwerty: S Shift, D Ctrl, F Alt, V Gui, M Gui, J Alt, K Ctrl, L Shift
  - Colemak: R Shift, S Ctrl, T Alt, D Gui, H Gui, N Alt, R Ctrl, I Shift
- Home block modifiers are not available on lower and raise layers, since they delay the symbol activation and are not that much useful anyway.
- Dedicated modifiers are available on the left side of the functions layer.
- One-shot modifiers are available on the left side of the navigation and mouse layers.
  - One-shot modifiers will be automatically deactivated after 2 seconds.
- In the base layer, holding Z or ; will activate the functions and media layers, respectively.
- In the lower or raise layers, the two opposite thumb key can be held (or tapped, for one shot) to activate its corresponding layer.
- One-shot layers and mods remain active with a double tap. Tap toggle layers will be toggle on with a single tap.
- The mouse layer can be disabled, using the maintenance layer. In this case, the navigation layer will be activated in its place instead.
