## A 34 keys split keyboard layout, optimized for programmers.

Here is where most of my code resides. My keyboards reference and extend this code, with keyboard specific definitions.

### Layout
- This is a 34 keys split layout, 3x5+2, optimized for programmers.
- This layout works well with the OS configured for the US International keyboard.
- This layout was designed mostly for coding and typing in English and Portuguese (but will probably work well for other latin languages).
- This layout considers the right hand as the stronger hand.
- The base layer can be either qwerty or colemak dhm.
- Use of keys in the two inner columns is reduced, minimizing lateral movement.

### Thumb Keys
- The four thumb keys control layer transitions, when held (navigation, lower, raise and mouse).
- The two outer thumb keys act as Special Keys, when tapped. See the *Special Keys* section below.
- The two inner thumb keys act as space, when tapped.
- Holding both outer thumb keys will activate the maintenance layer.

### Mod-Taps and Layer-Taps
- Considering qwerty, home block mods, mirrored in the other side of the keyboard, are available on most layers.
  - S Shift, D Ctrl, F Alt, V Gui
  - M Gui, J Alt, K Ctrl, L Shift
- Dedicated modifiers are available on the left side of the functions layer.
- One-shot modifiers are available on the left side of the navigation and mouse layers.
- Gui/Ctrl and Shift are also available as Special Keys, in the thumbs, see below.
- In the base layer, holding Z or ; will activate the functions and media layers, respectively. They can be toggled on tapping the same keys in the lower and mouse layers, respectively.
- Holding or tapping Z in the navigation layer will toggle the media layer instead of the functions layer.
- In the lower or raise layers, the two opposite thumb keys can be held (or tapped, for one shot) to activate its corresponding layer.
- One-shot layers and mods remain active with a double tap. Tap toggle layers will be toggle on with a single tap.

### Enter, Esc, Tab, Delete
- Considering qwerty, on the navigation and mouse layers, you find Esc in the Q and Enter in the P.
- Tab is present on the left side of the navigation and mouse layers, in the E, allowing easy access to Gui/Alt+Tab.
- Combos allow easy access to ENTER (JKL), ESC (SDF), TAB (WER or UIO).
- Shift+Backspace sends Delete, but Delete is also available under ; in the navigation layer.

### Symbols
- Symbols are spread across the lower and raise layers, making them easier to reach with a single hand.
- All symbols are conveniently placed for software programming and VIM commands.

#### Accentuation
- Using the lower layer, we can type `, ', ", ~ and ^ as independent symbols, while in the left side of the raise layer, we can find these keycodes as accents. I had to program some macros in qmk to make it work this way though.
- For example, considering qwerty, holding my left thumb + tapping s + releasing the thumb + tapping c, gives me 'c, while holding my right thumb + tapping f + tapping c, gives me รง. The same goes for the other accents.

#### VIM
- Symbols that are commonly used in VIM are placed in the right side of the raise layer, easily accessible using only the right hand. 
- Navigation with hjkl is ignored in favor of the navigation with the fingers in the home position, in the navigation layer. This trade-off turns the navigation easier and ubiquitous and makes even more sense when using Colemak.

### Special Keys

- Mod: This special thumb key behaves as follows, when tapped (not hold):
    - If no modifier is active or locked in one-shot mode, it activates the Gui or Ctrl modifier in one-shot mode.
    - In the maintenance layer, we can toggle between Gui and Ctrl, which makes it easier to transition between different operating systems, using the same key combinations for shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl+S, Cmd/Ctrl+C and Cmd/Ctrl+V.
    - If any modifier is active or locked in one-shot mode, all these modifiers will be released.
- Cap: This special thumb key behaves as follows, when tapped (not hold):
    - If CapsLock is active, it deactivates CapsLock.
    - If Shift is active or locked in one-shot mode, it activates CapsLock.
    - If Shift is not active in one-shot mode, it activates Shift for one-shot.

### Combos

In the base layers, considering the QWERTY layout:
- WER or UIO sends TAB. 
- SDF sends ESC.
- JKL sends ENTER.
- XCV activates the raise layer.
- M,. activates the lower layer.

In the lower layer:
- M,. activates the functions layer.

In the mouse layer:
- M,. activates the navigation layer.

In all layers but the base and maintenance:
- UIO swap hands for one shot.
- JKL return to the previous layer.

In the lower and raise layers:
- WER swap hands for one shot.
- SDF return to the previous layer.

### Tap Dance

- If the base layer is qwerty, the right pinky key, in the lower (numpad style) layer, sends backspace when tapped or held, while the key above it sends dot on single tap and comma on double tap.
- If the base layer is colemak, the right pinky key, in the lower (numpad style) layer, sends dot on single tap and comma on double tap, while the key above it simply sends backspace when tapped or held.
