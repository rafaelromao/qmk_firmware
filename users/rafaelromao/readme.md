## A 34 keys split keyboard layout, optimized for programmers.

Here is where most of my code resides. My keyboards reference and extend this code, with keyboard specific definitions.

## Keymap Highlights
- Home block mods for shortcuts that combine them.
- One-shot mods in thumb keys.
	- Cmd/Ctrl on the left side (you can choose which one will be used).
	- Shift on the right side (if already active, will toggle CapsLock instead).
- Symbols in the left side of the lower and right side of the raise.
    - All symbols reachable with a single hand.
    - Open all kinds of brackets with the middle finger. Close with the key at its right. 
    - Most used VIM symbols on the right side of the raise layer.
- Numpad in the right side of the lower and accents in the left side of the raise.
	- A combo activates the numpad using only the right hand.
	- Math symbols can be accessed activating the raise layer when the lower is already active.
- Navigation and Mouse layers activated holding thumb keys.
    - VIM style navigation, but in the home position (shifted one key to the right).
    - Mouse layer can be disabled (navigation layer will replace it).
- Combos allow easy access to Esc, Enter, Tab and layer switching.

## Keymap Details

### Layout
- This is a 34 keys split layout, 3x5+2, optimized for programmers.
- This layout works well with the OS configured for the US International keyboard.
- This layout was designed mostly for coding and typing in English and Portuguese (but will probably work well for other latin languages).
- This layout considers the right hand as the stronger hand.
- The base layer can be either qwerty or colemak dhm.
- Use of keys in the two inner columns is reduced, minimizing lateral movement.

### Thumb Keys
- The four thumb keys control layer transitions, when held (navigation, lower, raise and mouse).
- The two outer thumb keys act as Special Keys, when tapped. See below.
- The two inner thumb keys act as space, when tapped.
- Holding both outer thumb keys will activate the maintenance layer.

### Mod-Taps and Layer-Taps
- Home block modifiers are available on both sides of the base layers.
  - Qwerty: S Shift, D Ctrl, F Alt, V Gui, M Gui, J Alt, K Ctrl, L Shift
  - Colemak: R Shift, S Ctrl, T Alt, D Gui, H Gui, N Alt, R Ctrl, I Shift
- Home block modifiers are not available on lower and raise layers, since they delay the symbol activation and are not that much useful anyway.
- Dedicated modifiers are available on the left side of the functions layer.
- One-shot modifiers are available on the left side of the navigation and mouse layers.
  - One-shot modifiers will be automatically deactivated after 1.5 seconds.
- Gui/Ctrl and Shift are also available as Special Keys, in the thumbs, see below.
- In the base layer, holding Z or ; will activate the functions and media layers, respectively.
- In the lower or raise layers, the two opposite thumb key can be held (or tapped, for one shot) to activate its corresponding layer.
- One-shot layers and mods remain active with a double tap. Tap toggle layers will be toggle on with a single tap.
- The mouse layer can be disabled, using the maintenance layer. In this case, the navigation layer will be activated in its place instead.

### Caps Lock
- Caps Lock is available in the functions layer as well as through one of the Special Keys, but its behavior is not what we usually see. No matter how it was activated, Caps Lock will be automatically deactivated after 1.5 seconds of inactivity.

### Enter, Esc, Tab, Delete
- Considering qwerty, on the navigation and mouse layers, you find Esc in the Q and Enter in the P.
- Tab is present on the left side of the navigation and mouse layers, in the E, allowing easy access to Gui/Alt+Tab.
- Combos allow easy access to ENTER (JKL), ESC (SDF), TAB (UIO).
- Shift+Backspace sends Delete, when shift is not one-shot, but Delete is also available under ; in the navigation and mouse layers.

### Symbols
- Symbols are spread across the lower and raise layers, making them easier to reach with a single hand.
- All symbols are conveniently placed for software programming and VIM commands.

#### VIM
- Symbols that are commonly used in VIM are placed in the right side of the raise layer, easily accessible using only the right hand. 
- Navigation with hjkl is ignored in favor of the navigation with the fingers in the home position, in the navigation layer.
- For that to work better, hjkl and backspace should be disabled in normal and visual modes.
```vim
nnoremap h <nop>
nnoremap j <nop>
nnoremap k <nop>
nnoremap l <nop>
nnoremap <BACKSPACE> <nop>
vnoremap h <nop>
vnoremap j <nop>
vnoremap k <nop>
vnoremap l <nop>
vnoremap <BACKSPACE> <nop>
```
- This trade-off turns the navigation easier and ubiquitous and makes even more sense when using Colemak.

#### Accentuation
- Using the lower layer, we can type `, ', ", ~ and ^ as independent symbols, while in the left side of the raise layer, we can find these keycodes as accents. I had to program some macros in qmk to make it work this way though.
- For example, considering qwerty, holding my left thumb + tapping s + releasing the thumb + tapping c, gives me 'c, while holding my right thumb + tapping f + tapping c, gives me รง. The same goes for the other accents.

### Special Keys

- Mod: This special thumb key behaves as follows, when tapped (not hold):
    - If no modifier is active or locked in one-shot mode, it activates the Gui or Ctrl modifier in one-shot mode.
    - In the maintenance layer, we can toggle between Gui and Ctrl, which makes it easier to transition between different operating systems, using the same key combinations for shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl+S, Cmd/Ctrl+C and Cmd/Ctrl+V.
    - If any modifier is active or locked in one-shot mode, all these modifiers will be released.
- Cap: This special thumb key behaves as follows, when tapped (not hold):
    - If CapsLock is active, it deactivates CapsLock.
    - If Shift is active or locked in one-shot mode, it activates CapsLock.
    - If Shift is not active in one-shot mode, it activates Shift for one-shot.

### Combos

In the base layers, considering the QWERTY layout:
- UIO sends TAB. 
- SDF sends ESC.
- JKL sends ENTER.
- XCV activates the raise layer.
- M,. activates the lower layer.

In the lower layer:
- M,. activates the functions layer.

In the mouse layer:
- M,. activates the navigation layer.

In all layers but the base and maintenance:
- JKL return to the previous layer.

### Tap Dance

- The key below the right pinky key, in the lower (numpad style) layer, sends dot on single tap and comma on double tap.
- The first and second mouse buttons can be triggered tapping or holding the same key, as well as the third and fourth buttons.
